## Etienne Israel Palos

Welcome to my page! Here you will find information regarding my education and research! 

## Undergraduate at UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL AUTÓNOMA DE MÉXICO , B.S. in Nanotechnology

Currently an undergraduate student (senior) at Centro de Nanociencias y Nanotecnología (CNyN), UNAM, in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico. My major is in Nanotechnology with emphasis in nanostructure physics and catalysis.



## Computational Materials Physicist in training
I am a member of the `Computational Nanotechnology Lab` at CNyN, under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Guerrero Sánchez] (https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=XOBMvEIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (advisor) and principal investigador (PI), [Dr. Noboru Takeuhi Tan] (https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=NK4ag9QAAAAJ&hl=en). My current project focuses on data-driven materials discovery in solids and two-dimensional materials. My main tools include _The Materials Project_ `(pymatgen)` for structure prediction and _Quantum Espresso_ `(PWscf)`for Density Functional Theory (DFT) computation. We are strongly interested in validating our results experimentally.


In the past, I have worked with professors [Dr. Donald H. Galván] (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Galvan) and [Dr. Armando Reyes Serrato] (https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=WunCTY8AAAAJ&hl=en), describing the electronic structure of a predicted ternary compound, rhenium carbonitride. Our work resulted in a publication (see below).
