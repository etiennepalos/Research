## About Me:

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Paesani](http://paesanigroup.ucsd.edu/index.html) lab, at the  [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UC San Diego](https://chemistry.ucsd.edu/). I am interested in the development and implementation of theoretical methods for simulations of complex chemical systems across all phases, albeit my main areas of focus are condensed phases. I aim at understanding many-body interactions in molecular systems, from molecular dynamics to chemcial dynamics. 

Current projects:
I) Many-body formulation of hybrid quantum/classical simulations (QM/MB or QM/MB-MM)
II) Many-body potentials for molecular interactions with arbitrary _ab initio_ accuracy  (MB-QM, e.g. MB-DFT)
III) Emergence of the collective properties of liquids from quantum mechanics and many-body interactions 

I hope to contribute to the development of methods that can provide descriptions of such systems on a unified level, from the isolated molecule to the thermodynamic limit.

Prior to UC San Diego, I concluded my undergraduate studies (B.S.) in Nanotechnology, with a minor in Condensed Matter Physics, at [Centro de Nanociencias y Nanotecnología (CNyN)](https://www.cnyn.unam.mx/) - [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/). During my time at UNAM, I joined the _Laboratorio Virtual de Modelado de Materiales (LVMM)_, where I dove into the heart of condensed matter theory; solid-state phsyics. I left the LVMM with a number of conference presentations, two first-author publications, friends and collaborators, and a desire to dive deeper into theoretical chemistry and physics.

I owe in great part my vision as a scientist to [Prof. Joel Yuen-Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fCQ27T4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at UC San Diego. I was fortunate enough to interact with his group at UC San Diego while I was an undergraduate at UNAM, and worked in his lab in the summer of 2018 on deriving semiclassical models for dispersion relations in polaritonic metasurfaces. It was during this summer that I learned to see science through the eyes of a phenomenologist, and I matured into a scientist who would focus on the bigger picture, and let the physics guide the calculations. 

These experiences have shaped me as a scientist and as a person, and it motivates me to continue my endeavour in theoretical and computational chemistry. My _personal_ long-term goal, is to be able to work very closely with "paper and pen" theorists and experimentalists, to help bridge the gap between fundamental theory and experiment through rigorous and physically justified computations. 


## Research Areas:
My research focuses on many-body interactions and quantum chemistry in the condensed phase. It falls in the interface between theoretical and computational:
- Chemical Physics: solvation, charge-transfer, quantum multiscale simulations of many-body systems.
- Condensed Matter Physics: Multi-phase equilibirum, electronic structure under different thermodynamic conditions, band structure of solids and 2D materials.
