Welcome to my page! Here you will find information regarding my education and research! 

[Check my CV](/CV.pdf)



### Undergraduate at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México , B.S. in Nanotechnology

Currently an undergraduate student (senior) at [Centro de Nanociencias y Nanotecnología (CNyN)](https://www.cnyn.unam.mx/), [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/), in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico. My major is in Nanotechnology with emphasis in Nanostructure Physics.



### Computational Materials Physicist in training
I am a member of the `Materials Modeling Virtual Lab` at CNyN, under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Guerrero Sánchez](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=XOBMvEIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (my mentor) and lab head, [Dr. Noboru Takeuhi Tan](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=NK4ag9QAAAAJ&hl=en). My current projects focus on (a) data-driven discovery of new Transition Metal Chalcogenide semiconductors and thermmoelectric materials (woo-hoo!) and (b) new 2D materials for spintronics (MAGNETIC 2D MATERIALS!)
My main tools include databases (e.g._The Materials Project_) for structure prediction and _Quantum ESPRESSO_ `(PWscf)` for Density Functional Theory (DFT) as well as _VASP_.


In the past, I have worked with professors [Dr. Donald H. Galván](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Galvan) and [Dr. Armando Reyes Serrato](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=WunCTY8AAAAJ&hl=en), describing the electronic structure of a predicted ternary compound, rhenium carbonitride (ReCN). Our work resulted in a publication (see below). 

### Publications

### Computational Condensed Matter Club (CCMC) 
The CCMC is a community (i.e. a club) of academics and students alike in the forefront of research in materials physics and chemistry. Our mission is to promote research and education in all fields surrounding materials sciecne, with an emphasis on theory and computation.
