# Etienne Israel Palos

Welcome to my page! Here you will find information regarding my education and research! 

[Check my CV](/E_Palos_CV.pdf)



### Undergraduate at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México , B.S. in Nanotechnology

Currently an undergraduate student (senior) at [Centro de Nanociencias y Nanotecnología (CNyN)](https://www.cnyn.unam.mx/), [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/), in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico. My major is in Nanotechnology with emphasis in nanostructure physics and catalysis.



### Computational Materials Physicist in training
I am a member of the `Computational Nanotechnology Lab` at CNyN, under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Guerrero Sánchez](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=XOBMvEIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (advisor) and principal investigador (PI), [Dr. Noboru Takeuhi Tan](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=NK4ag9QAAAAJ&hl=en). My current project focuses on data-driven materials discovery in solids and two-dimensional materials. My main tools include _The Materials Project_ `(pymatgen)` for structure prediction and _Quantum Espresso_ `(PWscf)`for Density Functional Theory (DFT) computation. We are strongly interested in validating our results experimentally.


In the past, I have worked with professors [Dr. Donald H. Galván](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Galvan) and [Dr. Armando Reyes Serrato](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=WunCTY8AAAAJ&hl=en), describing the electronic structure of a predicted ternary compound, rhenium carbonitride. Our work resulted in a publication (see below). 

### Publications

### Computational CondMatt Club (CCMC) 
The CCMC is a community (i.e. a club) of academics and students alike in the forefront of research in materials physics and chemistry. Our mission is to promote research and education in all fields surrounding materials sciecne, with an emphasis on theory and computation.
