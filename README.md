# Etienne Israel Palos

## ABOUT 

Starting this fall 2020, I will begin my Ph.D. studies at the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UC San Diego](https://chemistry.ucsd.edu/), where I will work under [Professor Francesco Paesani](http://paesanigroup.ucsd.edu/index.html) as a recipient of the ***Alfred P. Sloan Graduate Fellowship.*** 

Graduated from [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/) this year (2020). I completed my thesis in the field of Computational Materials Physics as a ***CONACyT Scholar (SNI III Research Assistant)***, under Dr. Jonathan Guerrero Sánchez.

## RESEARCH
### Research Interets
Chemical Physics + Condensed Matter Physics 

### Research at UNAM

I have carried out my studies in Nanotechnology at [Centro de Nanociencias y Nanotecnología (CNyN)](https://www.cnyn.unam.mx/) - [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/)in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico. I am a member of the `Materials Modeling Virtual Lab` at CNyN, under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Guerrero Sánchez](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=XOBMvEIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

**My current projects focus on**

***(a)*** Data-driven discovery and first-principles characterization of new complex Transition Metal Chalcogenides for applications in optoelectronics. Particularly, I am focusing on understanding the electronic structure of alkali-metal transition-metal chalcogenides.

***(b)*** Prediction and first-principles modeling of novel quantum materials, such as ferromagnetic two-dimensional materials, for applications in emerging technologies such as spintronics. In this spirit, I intend to propose monolayer ternary transition metal chalcogenides with promising applications and a complex electronic structure.

**From 2017 to 2018**, I worked under the mentorship of professors Donald H. Galván and  Armando Reyes Serrato  on theoretical materials physics. Under their guidance, I worked on an effective Hamiltonian (Tight-Binding) to model the electronic band structure of rhenium carbonitride.    

### Outside UNAM 
**In 2018**, I worked in the [Joel Yuen-Zhou Theoretical Chemistry group](http://yuenzhougroup.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego as a ***STARS Scholar***. There, I worked on the development of an effective theoretical model to describe [polaritons](https://www.nature.com/subjects/polaritons) in hybrid organic/metal interfaces.

**In 2017**, I spent my summer in the [Sailor lab](http://sailorgroup.ucsd.edu/), under Michael J. Sailor atUC San Diego. I was a participant of the [2017 Summer School for Silicon Nanotechnology](http://sailorgroup.ucsd.edu/courses/SummerSchool/2017_participants.html). My contribution was through the computational design of waveguides for the elctrochemical preparation of *p*-Si (porous Silicon) photonic crystals. 

**In 2016**, I worked at [Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnoloógico en Electroquímica (CIDETEQ)](https://www.cideteq.mx/) on the electrochemical synthesis of chitosan nanoparticles for drug delivery. Not very related to what I do now, huh? This was under the mentorship of [Professor Teresita Oropeza](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=8bi7nYIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
