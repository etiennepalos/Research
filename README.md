## ABOUT 

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Francesco Paesani](http://paesanigroup.ucsd.edu/index.html) lab, at the  [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UC San Diego](https://chemistry.ucsd.edu/). I am interested in the development and implementation of theoretical methodlogies for simulations of complex systems  chemical systems in the condensed phases. 

Before coming to UC San Diego, I carried out my undergraduate studies in Nanotechnology at [Centro de Nanociencias y Nanotecnología (CNyN)](https://www.cnyn.unam.mx/) - [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/).
